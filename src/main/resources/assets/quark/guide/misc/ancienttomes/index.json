["# Ancient Tomes","Ancient Tomes are a rare loot item from dungeons and stronghold libraries. They come only in the highest level of an enchantment and can be combined with an Enchanted Book of the same enchantment to create one that's a level higher than the max. This costs 35 levels to create the book and an extra 35 to apply it.","","The tomes can not be directly applied to an item. They also never contain enchantments that have no level or \"Protection\" type enchantments.",null,{"id":"image","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vazkii/Quark/master/web/img/modules/misc/ancient-tomes.jpg","width":200,"height":200},null,"This feature was introduced in Minecraft 1.9."]
