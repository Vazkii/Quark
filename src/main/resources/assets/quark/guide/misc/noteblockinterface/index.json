["# Note Block Interface","Note Blocks get an interface when right clicked. A piano button layout shows up where you can set the note that the block will play. If you prefer the vanilla clicks system, you can click the note block icon to mimic that behaviour, and each note button has the amount of clicks needed under the note name.","","Other players will hear you using the interface, and the piano keys are all keybound, so you can use it to play songs ingame, if you want to!",null,{"id":"image","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vazkii/Quark/master/web/img/modules/misc/note-block-gui.jpg","width":200,"height":200},null,"This feature was introduced in Minecraft 1.11."]
