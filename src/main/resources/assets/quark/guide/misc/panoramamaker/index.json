["# Panorama Maker","Holding Ctrl and Shift (or Cmd and Shift in a Mac) while taking a screenshot takes a \"Panorama Screenshot\". Panorama screenshots are split into 6 low resolution images and can be used for resource packs to change the title screen look.","","Furthermore, when loading the game, a random panorama screenshot the player has taken will be chosen to replace the vanilla panorama in the title screen. Panorama screenshots are stored in a \"panoramas\" folder under the \"screenshots\" folder, and sorted by folders. Renaming one of the inner folders to \"main_menu\" will make that image always show up in the title screen.",null,{"id":"image","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vazkii/Quark/master/web/img/modules/misc/panorama-maker.jpg","width":200,"height":200},null,"This feature was introduced in Minecraft 1.9."]
