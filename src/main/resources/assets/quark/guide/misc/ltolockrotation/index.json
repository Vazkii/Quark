["# L to Lock Rotation","Pressing the L key (rebindable) will lock a rotation, and optionally a block half, if you're looking at a block. Any further blocks placed are changed to that direction, regardless of how you were facing when placing them. This can be very useful for building with blocks that have awkward rotation methods, such as stairs or pistons.","","To unlock the rotation press the key again while looking in the same direction you locked in.",null,{"id":"image","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vazkii/Quark/master/web/img/modules/misc/lock-rotation.jpg","width":200,"height":200},null,"This feature was introduced in Minecraft 1.11."]
