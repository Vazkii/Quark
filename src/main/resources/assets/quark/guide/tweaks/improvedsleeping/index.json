["# Improved Sleeping","Some tweaks are made to sleeping:","If a player does not input any keystrokes or mouse clicks for 2 minutes, they'll be marked as AFK. AFK players do not count towards the sleep vote.","When a player enters a bed, that action and the amount of players sleeping is broadcasted to the server.","A percentage of players required for the day to turn over can be configured, defaulting to 100%.",null,{"id":"image","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vazkii/Quark/master/web/img/modules/tweaks/improved-sleeping.jpg","width":200,"height":200},null,"This feature was introduced in Minecraft 1.12."]
