["# Texture Changes","Quark generates a \"low priority resource pack\", changing some textures to less rough or more sensible variants. Each of these can be turned off individually, and will be overriden by any other resource pack you load on top. The current changes are as follows:","1.8 Stones (smoother texture)","Bricks (some color variance)","Glass (less spots)","Pistons (model swap to look like the pocket edition ones, sticky piston sides, 1.11 only)","Pumpkin (disables the face, off by default)","Bow (improved pull animation, with more frames)",null,{"id":"image","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vazkii/Quark/master/web/img/modules/tweaks/texture-changes.jpg","width":200,"height":200},null,"This feature was introduced in Minecraft 1.10."]
