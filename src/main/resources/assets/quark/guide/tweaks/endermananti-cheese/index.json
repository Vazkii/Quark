["# Enderman Anti-Cheese","Going under a 2 block high area while being attacked by an enderman will have the enderman pick up and drop the blocks you are hiding under. This ability is negated in Easy mode.","","Note: prior to 1.11, this would have endermen teleport you to them. An option is present to switch to the old behaviour, if you prefer.",null,{"id":"image","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vazkii/Quark/master/web/img/modules/tweaks/ender-cheese.jpg","width":200,"height":200},null,"This feature was introduced in Minecraft 1.9."]
