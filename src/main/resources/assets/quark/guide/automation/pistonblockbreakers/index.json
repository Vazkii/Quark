These can break anything the piston can push.","","Iron Rods are crafted with 2 Iron Ingots and an End Rod, or just 3 Iron Ingots if you enable easy mode in the config.","","Note: In 1.10, a normal End Rod block is used instead.",null,{"id":"image","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vazkii/Quark/master/web/img/modules/automation/piston-block-breakers.jpg","width":200,"height":200},null,"This feature was introduced in Minecraft 1.10."]
