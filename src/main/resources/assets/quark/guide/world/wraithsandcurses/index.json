["# Wraiths and Curses","Wraiths are mobs that will spawn rarely in the nether, on Soul Sand. They spawn in packs and attack like a Zombie, albiet moving faster. When they strike their target, they inflict a short Slowness debuff and knock themselves back. Fighting them standing still is a bad idea. They also don't have their own sounds, instead appropriating other mobs' sounds.","","Wraiths drop a Soul Bead item. Right clicking it will break it, and inflict a Curse debuff on the player for 20 minutes. Mobs in a 64 block radius of a player with Curse will spawn ignoring light levels and other conditions (like slime chunk restrictions). Curse can not be cleansed with Milk.",null,{"id":"image","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vazkii/Quark/master/web/img/modules/world/wraiths.jpg","width":200,"height":200},null,"This feature was introduced in Minecraft 1.10."]
