["# Glass Item Frame","Crafting an Item Frame with Glass Panes makes a Glass Item Frame. The frame itself will not render while an item is inside, and items inside render a bit larger than a normal Item Frame.","","Some items will display differently on these frames. Shields will be a bit larger, and thus at a 1:1 scale. Banners will be scaled down to be square, and usable as wallpaper.",null,{"id":"image","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vazkii/Quark/master/web/img/modules/decoration/glass-item-frame.jpg","width":200,"height":200},null,"This feature was introduced in Minecraft 1.11."]
