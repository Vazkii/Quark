["# Auto Tool Restock","If you break a tool and have a replacement in your inventory, the replacement will be instantly moved to your hotbar, so you can continue doing what you were doing.","","This also understands important enchantments, so if you were mining with a silk touch pick, it'll try to find a silk touch pick before trying anything else. It also gives priority to tools of the same material.",null,{"id":"image","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vazkii/Quark/master/web/img/modules/management/auto-tool-restock.jpg","width":200,"height":200},null,"This feature was introduced in Minecraft 1.12.","This feature disables itself if the InvTweaks mod is loaded to prevent content overlap."]
