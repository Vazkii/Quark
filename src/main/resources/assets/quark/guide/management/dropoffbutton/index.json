["# Dropoff Button","A \"Dropoff\" button is added to the inventory screen. Pressing this button deposits everything in your inventory (not hotbar, armor or off-hand) in nearby chests. The range it stores in is similar to the player's reach, so it won't store items in chests the player can't open. The closest chests are picked first.","","If Shift is held, it stores items in \"smart\" mode, meaning it'll only store items in chests that already have at least one of that item.","","This feature can be disabled from clients using /gamerule quark_allowDropoff false",null,{"id":"image","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vazkii/Quark/master/web/img/modules/management/dropoff.jpg","width":200,"height":200},null,"This feature was introduced in Minecraft 1.9."]
