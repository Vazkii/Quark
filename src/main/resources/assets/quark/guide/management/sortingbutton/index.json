["# Sorting Button","A \"Sort\" button is added to the inventory screen. Pressing this button sorts your inventory, excepting your hotbar.","","Sorting is done via a category system, in which items are placed based on what category they fit in (food, tool, armor, block, etc.). Each category also has its own sorting rules, e.g. food will get sorted based on which is more filling; tools will get sorted based on which one is the best, or has more durability.",null,{"id":"image","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vazkii/Quark/master/web/img/modules/management/sorting-button.jpg","width":200,"height":200},null,"This feature was introduced in Minecraft 1.10.","This feature disables itself if the InvTweaks mod is loaded to prevent content overlap.","This feature disables itself if the InventorySorter mod is loaded to prevent content overlap."]
